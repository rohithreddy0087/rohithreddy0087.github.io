We introduce BEAR-Data, an open dataset that captures the dynamics of a large multi-zone building by providing measurements of zone temperature and corresponding HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) control actions for over 80 thermal zones. This paper presents a detailed description of the dataset’s collection process and features, and data analysis of system utilization and building thermal patterns. To showcase the dataset’s usefulness, we demonstrate one potential application of thermal dynamic identification and discuss how the released dataset supports various applications in building research, such as energy consumption forecasting, model-based control, and building performance benchmarking. We envision that the availability of this work can foster innovation and drive improvements in building energy systems.
