We introduce BEAR-Data, an open dataset that captures the dynamics of a large multi-zone building by providing measurements of zone temperature and corresponding HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) control actions for over 80 thermal zones. This paper presents a detailed description of the dataset's collection process and features, and data analysis of system utilization and building thermal patterns.
