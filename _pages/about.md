<!-- Education Section -->
<div class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">My Educational Journey</h2>
    <p class="section-content">
        Currently, I am pursuing my Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the prestigious University of
        California, San Diego, specializing in signal and image processing with a strong focus on computer vision and deep
        learning. My passion for this domain led me to obtain a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the esteemed
        Indian Institute of Technology, Palakkad, India. These academic pursuits have nurtured my love for innovation and
        problem-solving.

<!-- Experience Section -->
<div class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">My Diverse Experience</h2>
    <p class="section-content">
        As a Graduate Student Researcher, I am actively engaged in developing a multi-threaded desktop software application
        with Python/C++ Qt, utilizing server-client architecture and APIs to process data from numerous NTRIP/socket servers.
        My journey has also involved working with the brilliant minds at NASA JPL to analyze time series data using both
        supervised and unsupervised learning, leading to the accurate identification and classification of anomalies in the
        data.
    </p>
    <p class="section-content">
        My passion for software development and data analysis has driven me to intern at ITS Planners and Panasonic Research,
        where I contributed to various projects like traffic flow optimization, vehicle detection using image processing and
        deep learning, and blockchain security. Additionally, I have obtained extra online certifications in deep learning to
        continually refine my expertise in the field.
