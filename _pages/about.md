Welcome to my personal website! I'm Rohith Reddy Rachala, currently pursuing a Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC San Diego. With a strong foundation from IIT Palakkad, I've led impactful projects at the SOPAC Lab and ITSPE, specializing in software development and machine learning. My experience includes developing multi-threaded software applications, collaborating with NASA JPL, and leading the design of vehicle tracking software and traffic controller software. Proficient in Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and more, I bring strong programming skills to advanced computer vision tasks.

Beyond academics, I actively engage in extracurriculars and enjoy sports and entertainment. Let's connect and explore opportunities in Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Software Development. Reach out to me through my contact information. Looking forward to connecting!
