 <p>Hello there! Welcome to my personal website! I'm excited to share my journey and interests with you.</p>

<p>I have an insatiable curiosity for the fascinating world of technology, particularly in the realms of Computer Vision,Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Generative Learning, and Image Processing. These fields ignite my creativity and drive to explore groundbreaking solutions to real-world challenges.</p>

<p> I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of California, San Diego, with a focus in computer vision, deep learning, signal and image processing. My educational journey began at the Indian Institute of Technology, Palakkad, India, where I obtained my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering.</p>

<p>As an experienced computer vision and software development enthusiast, I have a proven track record of delivering impactful projects. At the SOPAC Lab, UCSD, I developed a multi-threaded desktop software application to process data from NTRIP/socket servers and collaborated with NASA JPL for time series analysis. During my tenure at ITSPE, I led the design and development of all traffic controller software and spearheaded the creation of a vehicle detection and tracking algorithm to optimize traffic flow. Additionally, I played a key role in developing various backend algorithms integrated into the Traffic Intelligent Server.</p> 

<p>My recent projects include researching multi-modal fusion techniques under the guidance of Dr. Nuno Vasconcelos at UC San Diego to enhance 3D hand pose estimation in challenging scenarios.  also like to work on the intersection of generative learning and computer vision, this led me to develop a project on counterfactual image generation using GANs and neural networks. This allowed me to create visually realistic alternative reality images with specific attribute changes. Additionally, I worked on an instance eraser algorithm, inspired by Google's MagicEraser, to effectively remove objects from images using instance segmentation and recover the background using GAN models. Furthermore, I successfully developed a GPU-based edge device vehicle detection and tracking system, integrating YOLOv5 and DEEPSORT, which enabled real-time vehicle tracking.</p>

<p>I possess strong programming skills in Python, leveraging its libraries like NumPy, OpenCV, Pandas, and Matplotlib and am proficient in TensorFlow and PyTorch, enabling me to develop models and algorithms for advanced computer vision tasks.</p>

<p>Beyond academia, I actively participate in extracurricular activities and social projects. At UCSD, I am currently hosting coffee chats in the microMBA program, refining my communication skills while connecting with fellow students and industry speakers. During my time at IIT Palakkad, I held leadership roles, participated in innovative projects, and won the Best Innovation Award for reducing paper waste. My leisure time is well-spent engaging in badminton matches, maintaining fitness through running, workouts, and swimming, and immersing myself in the captivating world of movies and TV series, with "Game of Thrones" ranking among my all-time favorites.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me and my passions. I am eager to connect with like-minded individuals, potential collaborators, and fellow enthusiasts in the fields of Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Image Processing. Feel free to reach out to me through my contact information. Let's embark on an exciting journey of innovation together!</p>
